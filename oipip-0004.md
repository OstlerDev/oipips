## Abstract

This OIPIP proposes to change the name of the data JSON Object in OIP from `artifact` to `record`.

## Motivation

Artifact can be misinterpreted. The second definition in the Merriam-Webster dictionary is:

```
2.a : a product of artificial character (as in a scientific test) due usually to extraneous (such as human) agency
2.c : a defect in an image (such as a digital photograph) that appears as a result of the technology and methods used to create and process the image 
```

This is particularly bad for scientific use of OIP.

## Actions

- [ ] Change all mentions from `artifact` to `record` in OIP softwares.  
- [ ] Change all mentions from `artifact` to `record` in OIP documentation.  
- [ ] Change all mentions from `artifact` to `record` in OIP-related press articles in preparation.  
- [ ] Make official announcement.
